<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## What is difference between Git and Github?

Git is defined as a distributed version control system (VCS) -- in other words, you can track and revert changes as a history log. Github is a web-based service that uses the Git revision control system to allow you to store local version control in the cloud so others can collaborate with you codebase.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Here is a quick guide for installing, Git on your system, syncing with Github, and using basic Git commands to push code to your repo. We will also deploy a basic site. 

<!-- Outline -->
## Steps covered in Guide

- [x] Use PowerShell or Ubuntu *(Not covering in this guide)*
  - [x] If using Linux via WSL, install a package manager, I use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) *(Not covering in this guide)*
- [ ] Install Git
- [ ] Download a IDE, I'd recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [ ] Add a local repository *(folder on your system, I typically name my folder 'builds' and keep in my 'documents' folder)*
- [ ] Intialize Git in local repository, Config, Stage, Commit
- [ ] Setup a Github.com Account 
- [ ] Sync you sync with Github.com credentials *(I'm using [Github CLI](https://cli.github.com/) to do this)*
- [ ] Push to Github
- [ ] Deploy your repository to a domain.:)

### Installation

1. You need to install Git on your system
   * [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
        After you install Git, by selecting your operating system. You can make sure Git is installed by running the following command in terminal. If everything installed correctly, Git should return the version that is installed on your computer.
        ```sh
        git --version
        ```
        _Note: you can install Git through PowerShell or via WSL._
 <br /> 
2. Create a local folder
3. Setup an Account at [Github](https://github.com/)
4. Via Termainal (only if Github CLI is installed) enter this prompt
   ```sh
   GH repo GithubUsername/Repository
   ```
